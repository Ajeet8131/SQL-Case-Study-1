# SQL-Case-Study-1
I am a database administrator. I want to use the data to answer a few questions about customers, especially about the sales and profit comingfrom different states, money spent in marketing and various other factorssuchasCOGS (Cost of Goods Sold), budget profit etc. My plan on using these insights to help find out which items are being sold the most. I have been provided with the sample of the overall customer data.
